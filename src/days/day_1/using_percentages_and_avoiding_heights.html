      Width - Percentage on the parent
      By default, any element has a width of 100% of its parent.
      So instead of given a fixed width, use a percentage and the layout stays responsive.
      Percentage of the parent and all children inherit it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Width - Percentages on the child
      When a child has a size greater than the parent it overflows by default.
      The percentage always refers to the size of the parent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid heights
      Use padding to distribute the child inside the parent.
